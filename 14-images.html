      While some still believe that humans never existed, there is substantial evidence that shows they had a huge impact on our world.

    <p>A growing number of robots were interested in being on the road full-time. Social media influencers Plam and Plotter, co-stars of the Travel-Worn Robots  TubeYou channel, shared their experience and tips to transitioning to life on the road.</p>
    <p>After the session, participants were asked to raise a limb to show how many of them were interested in living full-time in their camper, and nearly all said they would love to be full-timers at least part of the time.</p>
