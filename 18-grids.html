          <h1>Bubbles</h1>
          <p>Bubble Gum robot, or “Bubbles” for short, is from a family of track-footed robots that ¬originated from an experiment melding candy vending machines with robotics in the early 1980s. Bubbles is a favorite of Binaryville, not just because she generously dispenses candy, but also because she has one of the more "bubbly" personalities of the villagers.</p>

          <h1>Rex</h1>
          <p>Rex is the Mayor of Binaryville and a well-loved personality in town. He rose to robotdom from a microprocessor plant on the south side of town, where many famous and influential robots before him were conceived.</p>

      <p>Chipper and cheery jokes, stories, and songs filled the air this week at the 4th Annual Robot Roundup Vintage Camper Rally. While this joke doesn’t qualify as the funniest, it’s the first joke I heard when I walked up to the Rally’s first bonfire of the week, and was far from being the last.</p>
